// May have a total page header ( not fixed ) to supply tabs to other pages such as
// an imdb guessing the movie crossword or pokemon crossword, a leader board, etc. Could also
// have just typing speed game where the words are stright up given to you and you see how big of a crossword
// you can make in limited amount of time, maybe the old version of adding them would be good for this for 
// pure distance reachable. Since I have some ideas here: I should also have lives / hint buttons for the 
// crossword main game that can like reveal a letter or a whole word or fetch synonyms or something.
